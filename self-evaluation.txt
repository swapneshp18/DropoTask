This project is a drag-and-drop Kanban board built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and @dnd-kit/core. It allows users to view, add, and move tasks between three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Tasks are fetched from and updated via a REST API, enabling real-time syncing through polling. The project meets the core functional requirements, with a clean UI and responsive layout.
Implemented real-time drag-and-drop functionality.

UI is intuitive and mobile-friendly using Tailwind CSS.

Data is persistently managed through a backend API (with fetch + PATCH/POST requests).

The drag-and-drop feature breaks when newly added tasks are not structured properly.

Error handling is minimal.

Areas for improvement:

TypeScript integration is partial and could be stricter.

Code structure can be improved by splitting logic and UI into separate layers.

The handleDragEnd logic is functional but tightly coupled with the API structure, making it hard to adapt.

State updates (especially after new task creation) aren’t always reliable — this causes issues with drag-and-drop for newly added items.

Refactor drag-and-drop logic using useSortable from @dnd-kit/sortable for better UX.

Implement React Query or SWR to better handle server state and eliminate the need for polling.

Add optimistic updates to improve the perceived performance.
